# This spec defines what a spec is; it owns no code, so there is nothing
# to implement. `n-a` keeps `registry plan` from offering it (spec 042).

  Foundational contract: authored truth lives only in markdown (+ YAML
  frontmatter); machine-consumable truth is compiler-emitted JSON only;
  every artifact is a deterministic function of (config, file contents);
  a typed authority graph governs who-owns-what.

# 000: Bootstrap spec system

This is the spec that defines what a spec *is*. Customize it for your
repository, then author ordinary specs under your specs directory. Each
compilation unit links back here (or to a more specific spec) via
`[package.metadata.spec-spine].spec` in its manifest, a `// Spec:` comment
header, or a spec's ownership edge.

## 1. The authoring / derived boundary

Humans author markdown; the compiler owns the JSON. Never hand-edit a
derived artifact.

## 2. The typed authority graph

Specs declare typed edges (`establishes`, `extends`, `refines`,
`supersedes`, `amends`, `co_authority`, `constrains`, `references`) and
the units they own (file / section / symbol / directory / crate / module).
Authority is derived by walking the graph.
