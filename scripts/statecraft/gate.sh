# run it locally, and CI runs the same script, so the two cannot drift. Only
# the repository-local .bin/spec-spine is used; a spec-spine elsewhere
# on PATH never answers for this repository.
#
# In CI this script is read at the base commit and run against the candidate's
# tree (revision 5, rule 1), so a candidate never judges itself with its own
# gate. BASE_SHA, when set, names that base: the declared authored-content
# script is read there too, and the commit walk judges every commit with this
# copy. A local run names no base and runs the working tree's copies.
