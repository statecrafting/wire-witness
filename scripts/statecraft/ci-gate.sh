# Rendered by Statecraft from profile github-actions-rust revision 9.
# The aggregate gate. It passes only when every job the TRUSTED policy names
# as required ended the way its event requires:
#
#   required          must be `success`; `skipped` is an unexpected skip
#   required-review   `success` carrying a review result (findings,
#                     no-findings, or a visible skipped:<class>)
#   owner-exception   required (success) for a pull request whose review
#                     returned findings, and for a release candidate whose
#                     review was skipped; otherwise inapplicable (revision 2)
#   rc-exception      revision 1's rule: the release-candidate case only
#   recorded-review   a merge-queue entry (revision 3): the review is not
#                     re-run, so the job must be `skipped`, and the verdict
#                     recorded for the entry's pull request at its head is
#                     what admits it, with the owner exception for findings
#   inapplicable      must be `skipped`, and the rule that admitted it is printed
#
# A required job missing from the needs record has vanished, and blocks. The
# required set is read from the policy at the base commit, never from the
# candidate, so a candidate cannot drop a job from the set that judges it.
#
# An authority change blocks unless the owner approves it (revision 5, rule 2):
# when the candidate's own changes (BASE...HEAD) touch the authority set the
# base's policy defines (its files, the policy itself, scripts/statecraft/*
# and the declared authored-content script), the owner exception must have
# succeeded for this run, or, in the merge queue, for the run recorded for the
# entry's pull request. The gate computes this itself and reads no job's
# claim about it, so a candidate workflow that skips the exception fails
# closed. On push it is reported: the change was approved on its pull request.
#
# Inputs, all from the environment: NEEDS_JSON (toJSON(needs)), EVENT_NAME,
# HEAD_SHA, BASE_SHA (the pull request base, or the push's previous head),
# HEAD_REF (the pull request head ref; empty on push). On merge_group also
# GROUP_HEAD_REF (the queue branch, `.../pr-<n>-<sha>`), REPO and GH_TOKEN,
# which read the recorded review through the API.
#
# The family exit contract (revision 7): 0 passed, 1 blocked (a finding), 2
# refused (a precondition the gate cannot judge past), 3 usage (an input is
# missing), 4 failed. A command that fails outside a test is an operation
# that broke: the ERR trap reports it as 4, whatever its own code was.
